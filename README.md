# Kazik-Dumper
- My dumper is made up of pure fun and pieces of code found on the internet. Don't take it seriously, or you'll be a fool.

# Instructions:
1. Build the project
2. Inject into the game process before the main menu
3. Wait. The entire dump will be in Appdata/Local/Temp
- I don't think you'll need this
